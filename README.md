# üìä Predictive Analytics for the Indian Handloom Industry

A decision support tool designed to analyze socio-economic patterns and forecast financial outcomes for artisan communities in the Indian handloom sector.

This project delves into the socio-economic landscape of the Indian handloom sector by analyzing comprehensive data on artisan communities. The handloom industry is a vital part of India's cultural heritage and rural economy, yet many artisans face financial instability.

The goal of this project is to transform raw data into a powerful decision support tool. By leveraging data analysis and predictive modeling, this tool aims to:
-   Identify key patterns in debt, income, and sales across various artisan communities.
-   Forecast potential financial outcomes based on factors like yarn type, dye used, and market location.
-   Provide actionable insights to guide socio-economic policy and support interventions in rural textile regions.
